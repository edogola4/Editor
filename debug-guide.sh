echo ""
echo "📋 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1️⃣ OPEN BROWSER TABS:"
echo "   Open http://localhost:5173 in multiple browser tabs"
echo "   (The system will automatically generate unique document IDs)"
echo ""
echo "2️⃣ CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE:"
echo "   Press F12 → Console tab to see real-time debug logs:"
echo "   🔌 WebSocket connection logs"
echo "   👤 User ID assignments"
echo "   📄 Document room joining"
echo "   📝 Code change events"
echo "   🎯 Cursor position updates"
echo "   👋 User join/leave events"
echo ""
echo "3️⃣ TEST REAL-TIME FEATURES:"
echo ""
echo "   📝 CODE SYNCHRONIZATION:"
echo "   • Type in Tab 1 → Watch Tab 2 & 3 update instantly"
echo "   • Console shows: '📝 Received code change from: user_xxx'"
echo ""
echo "   🎯 CURSOR TRACKING:"
echo "   • Move cursor in Tab 1 → See cursor appear in Tab 2 & 3"
echo "   • Console shows: '🎯 Received cursor update from: user_xxx'"
echo "   • Colored cursor indicators with user labels"
echo ""
echo "   👥 USER PRESENCE:"
echo "   • User avatars show connected participants"
echo "   • Count updates: 'Connected Users: X'"
echo "   • Console shows: '👋 User joined/left: user_xxx'"
echo ""
echo "   ⌨️ TYPING INDICATORS:"
echo "   • Type in any tab → See 'user_xxx typing...' in others"
echo "   • Console shows: '⌨️ Typing started/stopped'"
echo "   • Auto-timeout after 1 second of inactivity"
echo ""
echo "   🌐 LANGUAGE SYNC:"
echo "   • Change language dropdown in Tab 1"
echo "   • See syntax highlighting change in all tabs"
echo "   • Console shows: '🌐 Received language change'"
echo ""
echo "4️⃣ MONITOR SERVER LOGS:"
echo ""
echo "   BACKEND LOGS (Terminal 1):"
echo "   🔌 New WebSocket connection: socket_id"
echo "   📊 Total connected clients: X"
echo "   👤 User connected with ID: user_xxx"
echo "   🏠 User joined personal room: user:user_xxx"
echo "   📄 User xxx attempting to join document: doc_xxx"
echo "   ✅ User xxx successfully joined document"
echo "   👥 Users in document: [user1, user2, ...]"
echo "   📤 Sent document state to user xxx"
echo ""
echo "5️⃣ DEBUGGING TIPS:"
echo ""
echo "   • If not working, check browser console for errors"
echo "   • Verify WebSocket connection is established"
echo "   • Ensure all tabs are using the same document ID"
echo "   • Check network tab for WebSocket frame details"
echo "   • Monitor server logs for connection issues"
echo ""
echo "6️⃣ TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo ""
echo "   PROBLEM: Still shows '1 user online'"
echo "   SOLUTION:"
echo "   • Check browser console for connection errors"
echo "   • Verify backend server is running"
echo "   • Check if WebSocket connections are established"
echo "   • Look for CORS errors in network tab"
echo "   • Try refreshing all tabs"
echo ""
echo "   PROBLEM: Code changes not syncing"
echo "   SOLUTION:"
echo "   • Check if document IDs match across tabs"
echo "   • Verify WebSocket is connected (green dot)"
echo "   • Look for 'code-change' events in console"
echo "   • Check server logs for received events"
echo ""
echo "   PROBLEM: Cursors not appearing"
echo "   SOLUTION:"
echo "   • Ensure Monaco Editor is fully loaded"
echo "   • Check cursor position events in console"
echo "   • Verify user colors are different"
echo ""
echo "🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo ""
echo "   ✓ Multiple browser tabs show same document ID"
echo "   ✓ User count increases as tabs open"
echo "   ✓ Code changes sync instantly across tabs"
echo "   ✓ Cursor positions update in real-time"
echo "   ✓ Typing indicators appear when typing"
echo "   ✓ Language changes sync immediately"
echo "   ✓ Console shows detailed debug information"
echo "   ✓ Server logs show connection and event details"
echo ""
echo "🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo ""
echo "   • Document Rooms: Each session gets unique doc_* ID"
echo "   • User IDs: Auto-generated as user_socketid"
echo "   • Real-time Events: 6+ different event types"
echo "   • Broadcasting: Socket.IO room-based messaging"
echo "   • State Sync: Document state sent on join"
echo "   • Conflict Resolution: Last-write-wins strategy"
echo ""
echo "🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo ""
echo "   • All browser tabs show 'Connected Users: X' where X > 1"
echo "   • Console logs show active WebSocket events"
echo "   • Server logs show multiple connections"
echo "   • Real-time code, cursor, and language sync working"
echo "   • Typing indicators functional across tabs"

echo "📞 Need Help?"
echo ""
echo "   If collaboration isn't working:"
echo "   1. Check this terminal for server errors"
echo "   2. Open browser console (F12) for client errors"
echo "   3. Verify both servers are running"
echo "   4. Check network tab for WebSocket connections"
echo "   5. Look for any CORS or connection issues"
echo ""
echo "🚀 Ready for testing! Open http://localhost:5173 in multiple tabs"
echo "   and watch the real-time collaboration magic happen! ✨"
